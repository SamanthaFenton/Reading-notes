## Reflection and Discussion  
Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and create a page in your reading-notes repo that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.  

Reminder: all your reading-notes assignments should be done locally, in VS Code. New files and changes will reflect in GitHub using your new Git-flow skills! (Remember… A-C-P)

    When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

    Ordered list — Used to create a list of related items, in a specific order.

    Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
     to change that you can use the start attribute, <ol start="10">

        margin-left
        padding-top

        What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
        The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders,
        padding, and the actual content.

        List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
        Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
        Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
        Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
        Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
        What data types can you store inside of an Array? any

        Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

        Yes

        items in an array are numbered, starting from zero. This number is called the item's index. So the first item
        has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. You can access individual items in the array using bracket
        notation and supplying the item's index,

        Note that an array inside an array is called a multidimensional array. You can access an item inside an array
        that is itself inside another array by chaining two sets of square brackets together.
        If you don't know the index of an item, you can use the indexOf() method. The indexOf() method takes an item as
        an argument and will either return the item's index or -1 if the item is not in the array:
        List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
        x = f() -The assignment (=) operator is used to assign a value to a variable. The assignment operation evaluates
        to the assigned value. Chaining the assignment operator is possible in order to assign a single value to
        multiple variables.
        x += f() -The addition assignment (+=) operator performs addition (which is either numeric addition or string
        concatenation) on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
        x -= f() -The subtraction assignment (-=) operator performs subtraction on the two operands and assigns the
        result to the left operand.
        x *= f() -The multiplication assignment (*=) operator performs multiplication on the two operands and assigns
        the result to the left operand.
        x /= f() -The division assignment (/=) operator performs division on the two operands and assigns the result to
        the left operand.

        Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

        Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
        When a password is required to access the page, if true then run the programme, if anything else then no.
        Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
        Uses of loops include cycling through values, adding sums of numbers, repeating functions, and many other
        things. Two major categories of loop uses are producing output and searching for information. You can reduce a
        long series of repetitive instructions down to one instruction by using a loop

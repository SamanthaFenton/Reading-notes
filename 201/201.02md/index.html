        What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements? The <sub> tag defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes
            rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O. Tip: Use the <sup> tag to
                define superscripted text.The <sup> tag in HTML is used to define a text as a superscript in HTML. A superscript is a text that appears half above
                    the normal baseline and is rendered in smaller-sized text.

                    How CSS Is Structured.
        
                    What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML? CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
                    Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
                    Internal - by using a <style>
                        element in the <head> section. External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.
                    Why should we avoid using inline styles? Adding CSS rules to each HTML element takes time and makes your HTML structure unorganized. It's difficult to keep up, reuse, and scale. The size and download time of your page can be affected by styling multiple elements.

                    Which components are considered properties? color and padding.
                    h2 {
                    color: black;
                    padding: 5px;
                    }
